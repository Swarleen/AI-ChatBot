## AS-IS Process Flow

Loblawâ€™s current customer service process is highly manual, involving multiple steps:

- Customers submit inquiries via email, phone, or website; agents log details into the CRM system.
- Agents manually categorize inquiries, retrieve data, and determine resolutions.
- Unresolved cases are escalated, documented, and tracked in the CRM.
- Final resolutions are logged, inquiries closed manually, and feedback is collected from customers.

This process is slow, prone to errors, and heavily reliant on manual effort, resulting in inefficiencies and delayed responses.
